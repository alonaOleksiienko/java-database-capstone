Smart Clinic Management System — User Stories
Overview
This document outlines the user stories for the Smart Clinic Management System (Patient Appointment Portal). The system serves three primary roles—Admin, Doctor, and Patient—each interacting with different components of the platform.
These user stories form the foundation of Agile development for this project. They describe what each user type needs to accomplish and why, providing clear direction for backend and frontend feature development.

- Filter by date or patient name.
- Each appointment includes patient details and reason.
D4	As a Doctor, I want to update medical notes or prescriptions after a consultation so that patient records remain accurate.	- Doctor can add or edit notes and prescriptions.

- Secure access (doctor sees only own patients).
3. Patient User Stories
ID	User Story	Acceptance Criteria

- Secure access with role-based permissions.
4. Technical & Non-Functional Stories
ID	Story	Acceptance Criteria
T1	As a developer, I want the system to use Spring Boot with MVC and REST so that the architecture supports scalability.	- Thymeleaf used for dashboards.
- REST APIs for modular integration.
- Spring Boot configured for dual databases.
T2	As a developer, I want to integrate both MySQL and MongoDB so that structured and unstructured data are handled efficiently.	- MySQL stores relational data.
